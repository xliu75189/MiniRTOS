* Mini Real-time Operating System (MiniRTOS)
* version 1.0 2025
*
* This software is to illustrate the concepts of Real-Time Operating System (RTOS).
* This MiniRTOS program is designed to use Array and Bit Map to implement Task List 
* to speed up task search time. Therefore, the task priority is limited 0-31. It allows
* same priority has more than one tasks. The same priority tasks are arranged with link list.
* For most applications, few tasks need at same priority. Therefore the same priority task 
* link list should be short, and its search time and variant should be acceptable.
